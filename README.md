# Time-Clock
A web-based timeclock app for Sunken Treasure Aquatics, my friends small business. This can also be used for general use, and will be open source so anyone can reference the code, or use this for their own business.


# To-Do

When a user is logged in, the NavBar should display their My Account button, with a button for settings.

Settings page should allow a user to change their name, password, and email address if needed.

When a user clicks the clock in/clock out button, text should appear telling them what time they clocked in or out
